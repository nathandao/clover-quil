# Vote for CLOVER!

It's Friday, we were messing around with Quil and ClojureScript - and we were also discussing a new tribe's name.

So, [vote for Clover!](http://vote-clover.surge.sh)!

# Development:

1. Clone the repo.

2. Make sure [```lein```](https://leiningen.org/) is installed

3. On the project's main directory:

```lein cljsbuild auto```

4. Open index.html file in the browser

5. Make changes to ```src/clover/core.cljs``` and reload index.html
